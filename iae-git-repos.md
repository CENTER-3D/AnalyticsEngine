# {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} GitHub repositories
{: #git-repos}

To help you get started with or learn more about different features and abilities in {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}}, you can view  and use the code samples in GitHub repositories to:

- Learn how to create and customize an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} cluster by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} command line interface (CLI). See [Using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI to provision a {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} cluster](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/IBM-Analytics-Engine).

  The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand the mechanics of deploying an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} instance with or without customization, dependent on your use case, using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI.

- Customize access to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} from the cluster by using a customization script. See  [Script for configuring access to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} from the cluster](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/IBM-Analytics-Engine/blob/master/customization-examples/associate-cos.sh).

  For details, see the [{{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} documentation](/docs/services/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-cust-cluster-script).

- Show you how to use the Hive endpoints. See [JBDC program that shows how the Hive endpoints work](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/IBM-Analytics-Engine/tree/master/jdbcsamples/TestHive).

  For details, see the [{{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} documentation](/docs/services/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-working-with-hive).

- Configure access to the Hive metastore from the cluster if you use a customization script to configure Hive after the cluster is created. See [Script to access the Hive meta-store on an
external MySQLl database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/IBM-Analytics-Engine/master/customization-examples/associate-external-metastore.sh).

  For details, see the [{{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} documentation](/docs/services/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-working-with-hive#externalizing-the-hive-metastore-to-ibm-compose-for-mysql).

- Show you how to use the Phoenix endpoints. See [Sample JDBC program that shows you how to use the Phoenix endpoints](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/IBM-Analytics-Engine/tree/master/jdbcsamples/TestPhoenix).

   For details on Phoenix, see the [{{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} documentation](/docs/services/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-working-with-hbase).
