# Resetting cluster password

You can reset a clusterâ€™s password by using the Cloud Foundry REST API. This API
resets the cluster's password to a new crytographically strong value. Note that
you must replace all existing service keys and rebind all bound applications
after the password is reset.

To reset the cluster's password by using the Cloud Foundry REST API, enter the
following cURL command:  
```
curl -X  POST  \
https://api.us-south.ae.cloud.ibm.com/v2/analytics_engines/<service_instance_guid>/reset_password
\ -H 'authorization: Bearer  <user's IAM token>' ```

For the United Kingdom region, use the endpoint `https://api.eu-gb.ae.cloud.ibm.com`

The expected response is the changed password in JSON format. For example:
```
{"id":"5259c951-689a-4eac-a48e-0ae22b45b786","user_credentials":{"user":"clsadmin","password":"modifiedpassword"}}
```

**Note:** To retrieve the
IAM access token, see [Retrieving IAM access
tokens](./Retrieve-IAM-access-token.html).
