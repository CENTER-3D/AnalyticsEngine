# HIPAA readiness
{: #hipaa}

{{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} meets the required IBM controls that are commensurate with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Security and Privacy Rule requirements. These requirements include the appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards required of Business Associates in 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and C of Part 164. HIPAA readiness applies to the following plans:

- Standard Hourly plan in the Dallas (US South) region
- Standard Monthly plan in the Dallas (US South) region

The BAA outlines IBM responsibilities, but also your responsibilities to maintain HIPAA compliance. After you enable HIPAA support in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} account, you cannot disable it. See [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Docs: EU and HIPAA supported settings](/docs/account?topic=account-eu-hipaa-supported){: external}.
