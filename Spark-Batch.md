# Spark batch jobs

There are three ways to submit a Spark batch job to an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} cluster:

1. By using the [{{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} Command Line Interface (CLI)](./WCE-CLI.html). This is the easiest and recommended way to submit and manage a Spark batch job.
2. By using the [Livy API](./Livy-api.html).
3. By logging on to the cluster using an [SSH](./SSH-connection.html).
