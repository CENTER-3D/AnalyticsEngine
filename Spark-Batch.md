# Spark batch jobs

There are three ways to submit a Spark batch job to an {{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} cluster:

1. By using the [{{site.data.keyword.iae_full_notm}} Command Line Interface (CLI)](/docs/analytics-engine-cli-plugin/analytics-engine-service-cli.html). This is the easiest and recommended way to submit and manage a Spark batch job.
2. By using the [Livy API](/docs/services/AnalyticsEngine/Livy-api.html).
3. By logging on to the cluster using an [SSH](/docs/services/AnalyticsEngine/SSH-connection.html).
